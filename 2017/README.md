# adventofcode 2017

The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken! We can't print the Naughty or Nice List!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost fifty bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in stars, you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: 25 milliseconds until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day millisecond in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

| 1 | X | X | So simple - just set up for each day README and reading from files. Basic loop and sum. |
| 2 | X | X | More looping and summing rules. Part 2 involves finding divisible pairs of numbers which is slightly more effort |

## Puzzles and Notes

### Day 1 - Inverse Captcha:

**P1:** Sum numbers in input string if they are repeated.

**P2:** Check for repeats at a specific distance in the string.

### Day 2 - Corruption Checksum:

**P1:** Read lines. Find min and max in list, calculate the difference. Sum results. Easy.

**P2:** Find numbers that divide evenly from a list. This was somewhat more interesting of a loop!
